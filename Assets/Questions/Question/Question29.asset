  title: Scenario
  question: 'You''re about to buy your first apartment near your college school.
    You have a loan from the bank and now have a choice between 2 areas. The first
    apartment is closer to the school and the costs are lower. However, the neighborhood
    is a bit sketchy and is known to have continuous problems. The other apartment
    is farther away from school and costs a bit more, but is in a safer neighborhood.
    You could also wait to see if some other options open up. Which do you choose? '

  answer2response: While gas costs are higher, you never wake up or return home to
    find your car or home is broken into. The semester goes well, and you find the
    purchase was worth the extra bit paid.

  answer3response: "It\u2019s in a relatively safe neighborhood and is cheaper, but
    the extra wait time forces you to have to take shelter in a nearby motel. A little
    bit of extra cost for a better opportunity. "
