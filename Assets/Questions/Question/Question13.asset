  title: Scenario
  question: 'You have $200 in cash and you want to transfer that money into your
    checking account. You find an ATM conveniently nearby, but as you''re approaching
    the machine, a person stops you. They say they''re associated with the bank that
    the ATM belongs to and that they''re there to educate young people on how to
    use an ATM. All you need to do is to give them your cash and they''ll walk you
    step-by-step through how to use the machine. Do you give your cash to them and
    let them teach you? '
