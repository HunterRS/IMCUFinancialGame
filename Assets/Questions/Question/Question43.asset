  title: Scenario
  question: "You are at the grocery store purchasing food necessities. You realize
    that you owe your friend $20 in cash for a favor that he/she did for you and
    he/she needs it now. However, you don\u2019t have the cash right now and only
    have a debit card. You know there\u2019s an ATM across the street and can make
    that withdrawal, but it\u2019s usually packed every day. But you also could pay
    him by mobile. What should you do? "

  answer2response: Most mobile apps would charge you for making such a transaction,
    especially if you want to make the transaction right away, as that would cost
    you extra money because of the fees.
