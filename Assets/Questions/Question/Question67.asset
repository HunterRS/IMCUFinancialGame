  answer1response: "People tend to buy rare and valuable items in bulk to increase
    the demand for the items, therefore allowing them to raise the price to VERY
    high amounts. These people are referred to as scalpers. You should never buy
    an item from them, as there\u2019s always a chance you\u2019ll find it eventually."
