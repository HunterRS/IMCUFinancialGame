  answer2response: You check for second-hand books, check for free PDFs online, or
    see if you can borrow them from a student who has previously taken the class.
    You also check to make sure the textbooks are required or find a way to share
    with a classmate. You save money on textbooks by not buying them all from the
    campus bookstore right away.
