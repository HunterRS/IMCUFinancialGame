  title: Scenario
  question: "You want to buy a new suit for work. There are 3 suits available, the
    first is a Blue business suit, costing $170. It looks really nice, but its material
    is weaker. The second is black and gray, and the material is softer, however,
    it costs $195 and it\u2019s one size smaller than your usual size. The final
    business suit is full black. Its materials are VERY strong and are made to last
    quite a long time! But it costs $225. Which would you choose? "

  answer1: Blue suit
  answer2: Black and Grey suit
  answer3: Most expensive suit
  answer1response: "Due to the weaker materials, you decide to take it upon yourself
    to take responsibility for the suit and try to make sure it\u2019s stable and
    cleaned the correct way. Your efforts work quite well. It lasts as long as you
    need it to, thanks to taking careful consideration of how to manage it."

  answer2response: "It turns out the small size made it difficult to take on and
    off every time you needed it. But\u2026 one day, when you're putting it on, its
    material rips in several places across it. You had to buy another business suit
    and rush to work! "

  answer3response: "It\u2019s easy to put on and take off every morning. It lasts
    more than as long as you need it to. While it was a bit more expensive, it was
    at least a decent choice for the time."
