  title: Scenario
  question: "You\u2019re having trouble delegating where your money should go. You
    find that you\u2019re spending too much on wants and not enough on needs and
    barely have anything in savings. You think it might be good to start splitting
    your money off: 50% to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Do you start
    using the 50/30/20 budget rule or continue to spend money aimlessly? "

  answer2response: "You\u2019re having trouble saving money because you kept spending
    money you didn\u2019t necessarily have to pay for wants instead of needs. As
    a result, your savings have quickly been drained. "
