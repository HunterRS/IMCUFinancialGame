  title: Scenario
  question: "Your boss has changed the building where you work at. You find yourself
    in need of new supplies for your new office in the building. You need to decide
    where to buy it from. There are 2 options. The first is a general retail superstore.
    It carries everything, from furniture to office supplies. The price is cheaper
    as well. However\u2026 These items are not of the best quality\u2026 The second
    is a well-known office supplies store. The office supplies are of better quality,
    but it has a limited furniture selection, and the prices are a bit higher. You

  answer1response: 'You go overboard with the purchases for the office, furniture,
    office supplies, and other supplies. You set up the office and begin to work
    in it. However, only 2 months after, there is a clear, noticeable sign of wear
    and tear in the furniture. The office supplies also continued to run out quickly,
    causing you the have to continuously return to the store to buy more. '

  answer2response: Due to the slightly bigger price, you decide to be a  conservative
    with what you spend, only buying the essentials needed for the office. You complete
    your office quickly and begin to work.  The higher quality of items prove to
    work, as you find that they lasted a VERY long time. And trips to the store to
    buy more were not too common. You're satisfied with the results of your choice.
