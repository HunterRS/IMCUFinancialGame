  title: Scenario
  question: 'You are about to set up a meeting in an office outside of your workplace,
    based on confidential matters for the company. You research online about possible
    spots to hold the meeting, and you find 3 options. The first is in a public library,
    within a closed-door meeting room. It costs $85.60, for at least 4 hours of time,
    with another $85.60 for every hour after. There is a concern though for the security
    of the meeting. The second choice is a hotel, but it costs $70 per hour. More
    expensive on the hour, but is more secure. The third option is a meeting room
    in a rentable house. It is very secure and costs $400 for the entire day. But
    the building requires you to supply your own tables, chairs, and necessities.
    Which would you choose? '

  answer1: Library
  answer2: Hotel room
  answer3: Building
  answer1response: The meeting had to be extended by 2 hours inside, meaning your
    total was $246.80. But was nonetheless much cheaper than the hotel. Unfortunately,
    the info got leaked out during the meeting, and you find some very sensitive
    info was found to have been stolen afterwords, and could very well be on the
    market.

  answer2response: You choose the hotel room, but it seems the meeting took 6 hours,
    costing a total of $420. But things worked smoothly. No info got leaked, and
    you find the extra cost outweighed the benefits of the first option.
