  title: Scenario
  question: "You decide you want to take a vacation to the beaches in Florida for
    a weekend. You need to find accommodations in Florida. Option one is a motel
    just east of  Miami at $175 a night with a 3-star rating. Option two is a Grand
    Hotel at $250 a night with a 5-star rating. The final option is a rental cabin
    house outside of  Miami, at $164 a night. While it is the lowest costing option, 
    you\u2019ll have to pay for gas to drive into the city every time. Which should
    you choose?"
