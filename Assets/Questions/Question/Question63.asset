  title: Scenario
  question: 'You receive a call from an unknown number and ignore it. However, they
    keep calling you every two minutes. You finally decide to answer the phone and
    the caller states that your bank account has been compromised and all the money
    is gone. You stay on the phone and get a computer to figure out what is happening.
    They ask that you download a certain extension and log in to your account on
    the computer. You log in and all of a sudden your screen goes black, but then
    comes back on, and you see that your bank account has zero dollars. What would
    you do? '
