  title: Scenario
  question: "You find yourself needing a new phone after you accidentally drop it
    onto the floor. You need to make an affordable plan for when you buy it. You
    have 3 options\u2026The first plan requires you to pay a bit extra for the full
    procedure but includes everything you\u2019ll need for its use. It also has a
    plan that covers when it is lost. The second plan has you pay off the phone with
    individual small payments coming monthly. The plan also has a bit lower total
    overall rate in the long run, with a repair plan along with it. The final plan
    has you paying in full right there, with a small discount on a full replacement
    if damaged. What do you choose?"

  answer1response: "You pay for all the extra protection and continue. Things go
    well for a few months, but then, your phone drops out of the window while driving.
    You think you are covered for your lost phone, but as it turns out, the \u201Clost,\u201D
    phone plan only covers theft. You\u2019ll have to buy another phone."

  answer2response: While making payments monthly is a hassle, it has overall been
    a very good choice to keep costs down. Not only that, but your screen broke one
    day, and a 15% lowering cost cut the amount needed to repair the screen even
    more for repairs. It turns out the cheapest plan is not always the worst one!

  answer3response: The price is fairly straightforward, and you use it for a couple
    of months. However, you clumsily drop your phone in the water. Thankfully there
    was a plan for full replacement, but the discount is only 10%. While not worst,
    one of the other plans might have been a better option
