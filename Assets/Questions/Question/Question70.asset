    an online shopping service. Prices shift regularly and it\u2019s possible to
    find a really good deal. The third is a friend is offering you a ticket for only
    $110 now, but there\u2019s no telling where you will sit. Which should you choose?"

  answer2response: Unfortunately, despite waiting throughout the week, the prices
    continued to rise on ALL tickets as demand for them became greater. You had to
    pay $200 for a good ticket. Much more than what you would have paid originally

  answer3response: It turns out the ticket was for sitting on the grass in the back
    of the field. While the ticket was much cheaper, it was kinda hard to pay attention
    to the action from far away.
