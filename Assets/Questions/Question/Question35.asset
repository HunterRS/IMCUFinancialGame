  title: Scenario
  question: 'You just received $500 from a friend. He/she recommends using that money
    to invest in some companies. You think of four companies, Disney, Netflix, Funimation,
    and Epic Games, as your top choices. Though there is one problem, how much should
    you invest in these companies? '
  questionfontsize: 9.5
  answer1: A quater of your money on each company
  answer2: A half to two companies
  answer3: Keep money to yourselve
  answer1response: "Investing is a huge risk taker and you divided it up into a quarter
    each. It\u2019s a good idea to do this as what if two companies start to fall
    off? You still have two other companies that are growing and don\u2019t need
    to worry about your money too much."

  answer2response: "While investing is a risk taker this is still a solid idea, but
    too much of a risk to take if you don\u2019t know the companies very well. A
    possibility of both companies going down, but it might not."

  answer3response: "Epic Games starts making A LOT of improvements with games, its
    members, and more. If you had invested in this company your stocks would have
    skyrocketed, but since you did not nothing was gained. It\u2019s okay to risk
    some of your money to a company and should always be considered. "
